### Hello, I'm Nic.

I like to apply Go and sensible process to infrastructure, reliability, and
scalability challenges.

I work at [Upbound], where I'm a Sr Principal Engineer. I split my time
between leading the [Crossplane] project's engineering direction and helping
Upbound product and engineering teams build the future of cloud (on top of
Crossplane).

[Prior to working on Crossplane][LinkedIn] I spent around ten years writing
infrastructure code on Platform and SRE teams at companies like Planet Labs,
Spotify, and Google.

Outside of work I'm an amateur pinball player (I'm on a pinball team), equally
amateur [packrafter] (I've spent a week on the [South Fork of the Flathead]),
and enjoy tinkering with my [E46 BMW M3] (I've changed a lot of fluids and
trim/body panels). I can be found out and about around Seattle's [Georgetown]
neighborhood most days.
