### Hello, I'm Nic.

I like to apply Go and sensible process to infrastructure, reliability, and
scalability challenges.

I work at [Upbound], where I'm the engineering lead for [Crossplane], an open
source control plane that lets you build your own infrastructure platform.
[Prior to working on Crossplane][LinkedIn] I spent around ten years writing
infrastructure code in SRE teams at companies like Planet Labs, Spotify, and
Google.

Outside of work I'm an amateur [packrafter], and enjoy tinkering with my
[E46 BMW M3]. I can be found out and about around Seattle's [Georgetown]
neighborhood most days.
